## Rationale

The Kudox is a keyboard project designed with ergonomics in mind. It uses Cherry MX style mechanical switches laid out in a 7x5 columnar stagger layout with components that can easily be sourced.

Kudox keyboard was forked from [Redox keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard).
